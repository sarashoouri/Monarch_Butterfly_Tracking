* "train_light.py" and "train_temp.py" generates the trained neural network models for the temperature and light.
* "test_light.py" and "test_temp.py" generates the heatmap results for the temperature and light.
* "model.py" contains the neural network models used in the Mobicom paper.
* Simply run the "Mobicom_Temp.ipynb"  to train the Temperature model, generate and save the heatmap results.
*  Simply run the "Mobicom_light.ipynb"  to train the light model, generate and save the heatmap results.
